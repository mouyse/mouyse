- 👋 Shalom, I’m Jay. Being an introvert, I prefer staying away from the social media accounts; except Reddit(If you really consider it one). Goodreads, Delancy place, The Ken, Mint, David Perell, Dan Lewis's Now I Know, The Harward Gazette, Aeon Magazine, are some of my usual go-to-places when I feel overwhelmed with work.
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my horizon by learning different technologies, keeping myself up to date with latest trends in technologies, global economies, and geo-politics. And I am an avid wanderer. I quite often take the road less travelled to reset my regular work routine; to meet new people, learn about different cultures, ethnic, and languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - How to stay consistent in keeping the learning curve upwards, being a good human, and trying to make the world a better place by contributing in whichever way I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting open source projects, and any non-profit project to give back to the society.
